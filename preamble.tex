Cost and effort estimation is a critical part of any major project. A wrong estimate can lead to a catastrophic failure. According to a survey, over 60\% of all software projects fail to complete within their estimated cost and time budget. On top of that, our methods for calculating the cost and effort of a software project are not very accurate. Most of the organizations make project managers calculate the current project's cost and effort by comparing it to a similar project they have completed before. This method is flawed since it assumes that the features of the project are excatly the same as the features of the previous projects. This is obviously not true as different project have different features that are driven from their scope, industry, and other factors. We aspire to develop system that can introduce new and far better solutions to the problem of cost and effort estimation. Our system will provide many ways of estimating effort including custom machine learning techniques, traditdional mathematical methods as well as providing a platform to make manual estimations and discussion between experts and managers, easier and seamless.
