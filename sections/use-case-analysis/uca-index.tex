\section{Use Case Analysis}

\vspace{20mm}

\begin{abstract}
The needs of a system, including internal and external factors, 
are gathered via use case diagrams. The majority of these requirements are 
design-related. As a result, use cases are generated and actors are identified 
when a system is studied to gather its functionality. The purpose of this study
is to determine the value of use case diagrams in software development. 
According to the findings of this article, the importance of the use case
diagram grows in proportion to the size of the project. Because the size 
of a project can be directly tied to its level of complexity. Large and 
complex projects always require the usage of a use case diagram so that 
engineers can quickly grasp the system's requirements.
A use case analysis is the primary form for
gathering usage requirements for a new
software program or task to be completed.
