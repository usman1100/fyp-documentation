\section{Software Requirements Specification}

\vspace{20mm}



\begin{abstract}
	In this chapter, We will discuss our
    functional requirements and non-functional
    requirements that will be used later on. There are two types of 
    requirements i.e Functional Requirement and Non-Functional Requirements.
    functional requirements define what the system does or must not do, non-functional
    requirements specify how the system should do it. Non-functional requirements do not
    affect the basic functionality of the system (hence the name, non-functional requirements).
