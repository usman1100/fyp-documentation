\subsection{Purpose}
\blindtext[1]

\subsection{Objective}
Following are the most important objectives of the project.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Improve the accuracy of software cost and effort estimation techniques.
	\item Get upto 50\% of software development organizations to swtich to automated software cost and effort estimation techniques.
	\item Get managers to switch to our product by automating their current estimation workflows and then  integrating our specialized techiniques with their existing workflows.
	\item Making our product compatible with most of today's tredning programming languages and their popular frameworks.
	\item Making our product relevant among the software development organizations and get 20 large software development organizations and/or 50 medium scale organizations to switch to our product by the end of 2023. And to integrate our product with their existing management routines.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Existing Solutions}
There are a few existing solutions in this problem space. Some of them are now not maintained and are deprecated. Following is a list of similar projects
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf{SEER For Software}}\newline
	SEER is a general purpose estimation tool that also has a product for software projects' estimation. It accepts input in form of SLOC (Source lines of code), function points, use cases and some more less popular options. After processing these inputs using proprietary models, the output of the program is as follows: Project time duration, development hours and accuracy of estimations.

	\item {\bf{TruePlanning \small{\textregistered}}}\newline
	This product is calculates its estimates using the PRICE model. Developed in 1975, TruePlanning is also a general purpose estimation system.
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Disadvantages}
Following are some serious shortcomings or disadvantages with the currently existing solutions
\begin{itemize}
	\item Outdated models that cannot adapt to today's rapidly changing and extremely diverse development languages and frameworks.
	\item No platform to enable communication between management and developers to discuss and agree to a better estimate
	\item Older and less commonly used input formats like SLOC and function points
	\item Outdated subscription methods. All of these prgorams implement a {\it{One Time Payment}} method. The disadvantage here is that the one time payment is a huge sum of money and may throw off a potential customer's interest in the product.
\end{itemize}
