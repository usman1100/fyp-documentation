\begin{abstract}
	In this chapter, we will be introducing the problem and the requirements that will be used to solve it. The purpose and main objectives that are at the core of the project will be explained in a concise manner. Along with those details we will also discuss the already existing solutions to the current problem and how these existing solutions are no longer a viable choice for consumers. We shall also discuss how our solution fixes the issues that were found in the existing solutions and how our solution/product will be a superior and generally better. After these details an executive summary will summarize all of the above discussions into a concise manner.

\subsection{Introduction}
The software industry is a multi billion dollar industry, infact it is projected to be around 1 trillion USD in 2023. This is due to the fact that software development is complex and requires a lot of resources. And just like any complex engineering project, much of these resources, time and effort goes into planning the development of the project. Successfull software developers and companies realize the importance of a well organized and well planned software development process. Without one, the project will more than likely fail to be completed. {\it{"Without requirements or design , programming is the art of adding bugs to an empty text file"}}, a humourous quote from Louis Srygley, well summarizes the need for  a well planned and estimated software development process.
\vspace{2mm}

After all the planning and design phases, team leads and managers have to come up with a time and resource estimate for the project. This is a crucial phase and a lot can go wrong here. According to a survey over 60\% of software projects fail to complete in the estimated time and budget. 












\subsection{Purpose}
The main pupose of our product is to improve the accuracy of estimate predictions. This will be done using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms that are trained on previous software development projects. The classifier will also improve significantly with the passage of time, since we will be recording statistics of all the projects that will be entered in the product. 

 The secondary puspose is to provide a platform where developers and managers can collaborate and share their options on the project's development and create estimates manually. Our product will basically give it's users the option to choose between different estimation techniques but the recommended techinique will still be the machine learnign classifier.












\subsection{Objective}
Following are the most important objectives of the project.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Improve the accuracy of software cost and effort estimation techniques.
	\item Get upto 50\% of software development organizations to swtich to automated software cost and effort estimation techniques.
	\item Get managers to switch to our product by automating their current estimation workflows and then  integrating our specialized techiniques with their existing workflows.
	\item Making our product compatible with most of today's tredning programming languages and their popular frameworks.
	\item Making our product relevant among the software development organizations and get 20 large software development organizations and/or 50 medium scale organizations to switch to our product by the end of 2023. And to integrate our product with their existing management routines.
\end{itemize}













\subsection{Existing Solutions}
There are a few existing solutions in this problem space. Some of them are now not maintained and are deprecated. Following is a list of similar projects
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf{SEER For Software}}\newline
	SEER is a general purpose estimation tool that also has a product for software projects' estimation. It accepts input in form of SLOC (Source lines of code), function points, use cases and some more less popular options. After processing these inputs using proprietary models, the output of the program is as follows: Project time duration, development hours and accuracy of estimations.

	\item {\bf{TruePlanning \small{\textregistered}}}\newline
	This product is calculates its estimates using the PRICE model. Developed in 1975, TruePlanning is also a general purpose estimation system.
	
\end{itemize}













\subsection{Disadvantages}
Following are some serious shortcomings or disadvantages with the currently existing solutions
\begin{itemize}
	\item Outdated models that cannot adapt to today's rapidly changing and extremely diverse development languages and frameworks.
	\item No platform to enable communication between management and developers to discuss and agree to a better estimate
	\item Older and less commonly used input formats like SLOC and function points
	\item Outdated subscription methods. All of these prgorams implement a {\it{One Time Payment}} method. The disadvantage here is that the one time payment is a huge sum of money and may throw off a potential customer's interest in the product.
\end{itemize}
